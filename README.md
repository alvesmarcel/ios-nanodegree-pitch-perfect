# Pitch Perfect

This is the first portfolio app from Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree. With this app, the user can record an audio and then apply some effects to it. Right now, there are 5 available effects: Reverb, Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Slow voice and Fast voice.

The last updates of this app include some auto layout constraints to resize the buttons based on the screen size. This feature is especially important for a good user experience in the iPhone 4S.
